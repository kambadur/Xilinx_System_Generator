### Xilinx System Generator

I have started to learn/explore MathWorks Xilinx System Generator blockset to simulate and synthesize my digital designs. 
I am taking examples from HDLBits and also from the text book DDCA from Prof. Sarah Harris and Prof. David Harris. I am writing RTL in verilog and parallely model based in XSG. 
The goal is to compare the simulation results from verilog rtl design in iVerilog/GTKWave with simulation results from generated Verilog HDL wrapper in Vivado.
This is just for learning and fun.
