#### HDLBits example: Carry select adder implemeneted in Xilinx System Generator
[Module Cseladd: ](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Module_cseladd)  
This repo contains XSG Simulink model for carry select adder example from HDLBits.  
I used simulink standard blocks to extract upper and lower haps of 32bit input operads for a and b. Later I came to know that there is a built-in block in simulink that can take care of this. It is called 'extractbits' located in 'Logic and Bit operations'.
